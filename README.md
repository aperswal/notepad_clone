# Notepad Clone
I wanted to create a desktop software so decided to create a notepad clone because 
it was the closest thing to a sophisticated beginner friendly software

## Technologies Used
1. Java
2. Java Extended Library
4. Java IO
5. AWT
6. Spring

## Learnings
Building software takes time but its not something to be afraid of. Overall project was a success
credits to "Code for Interview" for teaching me how to do this.
